# Platform

The Tradefeedr platform is a hosted Jupyter notebook provided by Tradefeedr. The platform is available at https://platform.tradefeedr.com.

The platform contains several layers:

- **Data layer**
  - Tradefeedr provides its clients the ability to access to their trading data in efficient, easy and user friendly way

- **API layer**
  - The lowest layer available to client is the API endpoints. Users can access Jupyter notebooks on the platform to query their enriched trading data and Tradefeedr analytics to help with trading decisions

- **Widgets layer**
**	The next layer up is the Tradefeedr visualisation libraries. These are a series of widgets built on top of the API layer.  The widgets form a set of Tradefeedr Python libraries for data post processing and visualisation.
Documentation on the widgets is found on the platform in the community section. They are available for Algo, RFS, RFS Bilateral and RFQ

- **Analytics template reports**
  -  Analytics templates reports are built on top of the widget layer. These are designed to be used as "dashboards" for specific analysis.
The reports for Algo, RFS, RFS Bilateral and RFQ are available on the platform. While they are designed to be used as a dashboard, they can also be modified.
The code for them is provided in each notebook allowing a technical user to easily modify them for their specific goals if required
