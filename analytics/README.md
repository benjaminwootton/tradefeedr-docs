This section of the documentation site provide you a detailed account of the metrics and field descriptions.

- [RFS Execution](../analytics/rfs.md)
- [RFQ Execution](../analytics/rfq.md)
- [RFS Bilateral Sharing](../analytics/bilateral-sharing.md)

This section also contains a comprehensive description on the Tradefeedr models being used.
The purpose of them and the reasons for the model parameter selection.

There are also workflow-spanning analytics:

- [Tradefeedr Mid Price](../analytics/mid-price.md)
- [Risk Transfer Price](../analytics/risk-transfer-price.md)
- [Algo Peer Universe](../analytics/algo-peer-universe.md)
