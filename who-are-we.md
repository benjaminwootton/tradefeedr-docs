# Who Are We

We are from London and we do really interesting stuff.

London is the capital city of the United Kingdom and one of the most historically significant cities in the world. Its origins stretch back over 2,000 years to the Roman settlement of Londinium, and since then it has grown into a global centre for culture, politics, finance, and innovation. Landmarks such as the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, and St Paul’s Cathedral reflect the city’s layered history, blending medieval, imperial, and modern influences into a uniquely rich urban landscape.

Culturally, London is known for its extraordinary diversity. More than 300 languages are spoken across the city, and its neighbourhoods—like Camden, Shoreditch, Notting Hill, and Brixton—each offer their own character, cuisine, art, and music. London’s museums and galleries, including the British Museum, the Tate Modern, and the National Gallery, are among the finest in the world, many offering free admission. Its theatre district in the West End rivals Broadway as a global hub for live performance.

London is also a major economic powerhouse, home to one of the largest financial centres on the planet. Its innovation scene is thriving, supported by world-class universities such as Imperial College London, UCL, and the London School of Economics. Despite its size and density, the city is surprisingly green, with expansive parks like Hyde Park, Regent’s Park, and Richmond Park providing open space and wildlife within the urban environment. This blend of history, culture, commerce, and green space makes London one of the most dynamic and influential cities in the world.
