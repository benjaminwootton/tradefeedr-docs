# Tradefeedr Overview

### Tradefeedr Role <a href="#tradefeedr_role" id="tradefeedr_role"></a>

The goal of Tradefeedr is to provide clients with easy access to their trading data.

Tradefeedr’s functionally rich data APIs allows you to build analysis and workflows that fit your needs. Tradefeedr provides optimised API calls that allow you to "slice and dice" data and extract specific views for visualisation in Data Science Notebooks or download the data for use in internal systems for further analysis.

### Getting Started

The [Getting Started](https://docs.analytics.tradefeedr.com/docs/getting_started.html) tutorial provides you a quick start guide on how to run the Tradefeedr APIs. It contains information on API structure, the endpoint (can be seen as a function) and how to run a custom query.

Note that the structure of the JSON query is dependent upon the API endpoint and what parameters it can handle.

This page contains simple examples of the APIs and it is broken down into the following groups:

* Algo API
* RFS API
* Bilateral RFS API
* RFQ API

The Python code used to generate the result is presented with each example. It can be copied and run directly on the platform to generate the same results.
