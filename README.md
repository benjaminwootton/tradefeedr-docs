# Tradefeedr Overview

### What Tradefeedr does

Tradefeedr provides clients with easy access to their trading data.

Tradefeedr’s feature-rich data APIs let you build analyses and workflows that fit your needs. Optimised API calls make it easy to “slice and dice” data—extracting specific views for visualisation in data-science notebooks, or downloading data for use in internal systems for further analysis.

### Start here

{% hint style="info" %}
If you’re new to Tradefeedr, start with **Getting Started**.
{% endhint %}

* [Getting Started](https://app.gitbook.com/s/HH7mE9Gn8xITJMgN16PA/who-are-we): a quick-start tutorial that explains API structure, endpoints (think of these as functions), and how to run a custom query.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The structure of each JSON query depends on the endpoint and the parameters it supports.
{% endhint %}

### API groups

The examples in this documentation are organised into the following API groups:

* **Algo API**
* **RFS API**
* **Bilateral RFS API**
* **RFQ API**

Where relevant, we show the Python code used to generate each result so you can copy and run it directly on the platform.

### User Guide

The [User Guide](https://docs.analytics.tradefeedr.com/docs/user_guide.html) provides an overview of the user guides available across the documentation.

Use it when you know what you’re looking for and want to navigate directly to the right guide.

### Analytics

The [Analytics](https://docs.analytics.tradefeedr.com/docs/analytics.html) pages describe the available metrics and models, helping you build a comprehensive understanding of the APIs and how to interpret their output.

For analytics walkthroughs, also refer to the [User Guide](https://docs.analytics.tradefeedr.com/docs/user_guide.html).

### API (remote access)

The [API](https://docs.analytics.tradefeedr.com/docs/api.html) page explains how to run the APIs remotely (outside the Tradefeedr platform), and provides an overview of API structure and its components.

For endpoint-specific guides, refer to the [User Guide](https://docs.analytics.tradefeedr.com/docs/user_guide.html).

### Platform guide

This guide explains how the Tradefeedr platform works and the layers it contains.

It is useful for understanding how the API, widgets, and template report notebooks are constructed, so you can customise or modify notebooks for your own needs.
