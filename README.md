# Welcome To Tradefeedr Georgia

Tradefeedr is a fintech company that builds a unified data and analytics platform for foreign-exchange (FX) trading and market participants. Their core offering is a secure, standardised API that aggregates trading data from multiple sources — liquidity providers, trading venues, ECNs, and more — and normalises it into a common format. This way, firms don’t need to wrestle with different data feeds and formats: they get a clean, “analysis-ready” data layer via Tradefeedr, whether they want raw transaction-level data or higher-level analytics.

On top of providing the data infrastructure, Tradefeedr offers pre-built analytics tools and dashboards for things like transaction-cost analysis (TCA), best-execution metrics, liquidity management, and execution quality review. Users — whether buy-side institutions, brokers, or trading platforms — can also build custom analytics pipelines or dashboards using the platform’s APIs and built-in tools. The idea is to let clients focus on trading strategy and business decisions rather than the tedious work of data engineering and reconciliation.

Beyond private data analytics, Tradefeedr also enables collaborative data sharing and benchmarking. Firms can — with permission — pool anonymized data and compare execution performance, or benchmark liquidity providers against peers. This helps to create transparency across the FX market and fosters a more level playing field: instead of each party sitting on siloed data, there’s a shared, independent foundation for decision-making, performance measurement and dialogue.
