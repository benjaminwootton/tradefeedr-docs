Name,Description
NumRuns,Number of Algo Runs
TradeQuantityUSD,USD Equivalent of TradeQuantity
OrderQuantityUSD,USD Equivalent of OrderQuantity
Duration,Order Duration in seconds.
AssumedRisk,Cumulative volatility of the market during ParentOrderID. Based on Tradefeedr intraday volatility model. Volatility is estimated for each minute and integrated over the duration of the algo. Expressed in basis points.
TradeIntensity,Trading intensity per ParentOrderID: average speed of execution in USD traded per minute. Equals to TradeQuantityUSD/ (Duration/60)
SpreadPaidBPSChildOrders,"Spread paid on child fills . TradeQuantityUSD-weighted average across of spread paid of all child fills and then across ParendOrderIDs if further aggregated (driven by ""groupby"").  For individual child order the spread paid is simply the difference between mid price and executed price expressed in basis points and adjusted for Side. Positive number mean buying above mid and selling below mid. Negative number is the opposite. Expresses in basis points. "
ArrivalMidPerfBPS,"Total algo performance to ArrivalPrice (arrival mid). Positive number means out-performance (buying below mid, selling below mid). Weighted average of ArrivalMidPerfTradeBPS and ArrivalMidPerfRemainBPS with weights being proportional to TradeQuantity and RemainQuantity.  Expressed in basis points. "
ArrivalMidPerfBPSStdDev,Standard Deviaition of ArrivalMidPerfBPS.  Expressed in basis points.
ArrivalMidPerfTradeBPS,Percentage Difference between ArrivalPrice (arrival mid) and AllInPrice. Adjusted for Side. Positive number means out-performance of mid price (buying below the ArrivalPrice and selling above). Expressed in basis points.
ArrivalMidPerfRemainBPS,Market move during algo execution adjusted by Side. When it is negative the market moved in the direction of trading making subsequent purchases more costly (e.g market moving up when algo was buying). This is used to adjust algo for un-executed amounts.   Expressed in basis points.
TWAPMidPerfBPS,Percentage difference between AllInPrice and TWAPPrice. Adjusted for Side. Positive number means out-performance of TWAPPrice (buying below the TWAPPrice and selling above TWAPPrice). Expressed in basis points
TWAPMidPerfBPSStdDev,TradeQuantityUSD-weighted Standard Deviaition of TWAPMidPerfBPS.  Expressed in basis points
RiskTransferCostBPS,"Risk Transfer Cost is the cost of alternative immediate execution (against risk transfer benchmark). The risk transfer benchmark is determined by selecting ""risk_transfer_benchmark"" in options. Aggregated across individual ParentOrderIDs as a weighted average with TradeQuantityUSD being the weights.  Expressed in basis points (to mid)"
RiskTransferPerfBPS,Performance of AllInPrice to Risk Transfer Price benchmark.  Positive numbers are out-performance  of Risk Transfer Benchmark (buying below Risk Transfer benchmark price and selling above) and negative number mean underperformance.  Aggregated as a weighted average across individual parent Orders with with TradeQuantityUSD being the weights.The type of risk transfer benchmark can be specified by selecting risk_transfer_benchmark in options. Expressed in basis points
RiskTransferPerfBPSStdDev,Standard Deviation of the RiskTransferPerfBPS benchmark. Aggregated as a weighted standard deviation with TradeQuantityUSD being the weights.  Expressed in basis points.
RiskTransferPerfIR,Information Ratio (RiskTransferPerfBPS divided by its standard deviation - RiskTransferPerfBPSStdDev). Unit free.
ArrivalMidPerfNetBPS,"Net total algo performance to ArrivalPrice (arrival mid).  Positive in out-performance (buying below mid, selling below mid). When aggregated it is weighted average of ArrivalMidPerfTradeNetBPS and ArrivalMidPerfRemainNetBPS with weights being proportional to TradeQuantity and RemainQuantity.  Expressed in basis points "
ArrivalMidPerfNetBPSStdDev,Standard Deviation of ArrivalMidPerfNetBPS.  Expressed in Basis Points
ArrivalMidPerfTradeNetBPS,Performance To Arrival Mid. Percentage Difference between ArrivalPrice and AllInNetPrice. Adjusted for Side. Positive number means out-performance of mid price (buying below the ArrivalPrice and selling above. Expressed in basis points.
ArrivalMidPerfRemainNetBPS,Market move during algo execution adjusted to the Side. When it is negative the market moved in the direction of trading making subsequent purchases more costly (e.g. market moving up when algo was buying). This is used to adjust algo for un-executed amounts.   
TWAPMidPerfNetBPS,Percentage difference between AllInNetPrice and TWAPPrice. Adjusted for Side. Positive number means outperformance of TWAPPrice (buying below the TWAPPrice and selling above TWAPPrice). Expressed in basis points
TWAPMidPerfNetBPSStdDev,Standard Deviation of TWAPMidPerfNetBPS.  Expressed in Basis Points
RiskTransferPricePerfNetBPS,Performance of AllInNetPrice (see parent-orders) to Risk Transfer Price benchmark.  Positive numbers are out-performance  of Risk Transfer Benchmark (buying below Risk Transfer benchmark price and selling above) and negative number mean underperformance.  Aggregated as a weighted average across individual parent Orders with with TradeQuantityUSD being the weights.The type of risk transfer benchmark can be specified by selecting risk_transfer_benchmark in options. Expressed in basis points
RiskTransferPricePerfNetBPSStdDev,Standard Deviation of the RiskTransferPricePerfNetBPS benchmark. Aggregated as a weighted standard deviation with TradeQuantityUSD being the weights.  Expressed in basis points.
RiskTransferPricePerfNetIR,Information Ratio (RiskTransferPerfNetBPS divided by its standard deviation - RiskTransferPerfNetBPSStdDev). Unit free.
ExecutionScore,"TradeQuantityUSD-Weighed-Average Scores of Individual Child Orders. Execution Scores  of individual child fills are calculated as rank-percentile of Price against the distribution of mid-price during algo execution.  It is the number between 0 and 100. For example, buy at the low of range would get a rank of 100 and buy at the high the price range would get a rank of 0 (reverse for sell order)."
ReversalScore,"TradeQuantityUSD-Weighed-Average Reversal Scores of Individual Child Orders. Reversal Scores of individual child fills are calculated as rank percentiles of Price against the distribution of mid-price post algo execution.  It is a number between 0 and 100. For example, buy at the low of range would get a rank of 100 and buy at the high the price range would get a rank of 0 (reverse for sell order)."
