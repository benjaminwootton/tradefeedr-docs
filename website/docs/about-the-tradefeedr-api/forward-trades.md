# Forward Trades

Forward trades are foreign exchange contracts in which two parties agree today on the exchange rate for a currency transaction that will occur at a specified date in the future. Unlike spot trades, which settle almost immediately, forwards allow participants to lock in a rate and eliminate uncertainty about future currency movements. These contracts are particularly useful for businesses with upcoming international payments or revenues, enabling them to hedge against unfavorable shifts in exchange rates. Because forward rates are derived from interest rate differentials between the two currencies—rather than current market prices—they offer flexibility without requiring upfront payment. As a result, forward trades are a key tool in managing currency risk and planning financial commitments with greater confidence.
