# Spot Trades

Spot FX trades are foreign exchange transactions in which two parties agree to exchange one currency for another at the current market rate, with settlement typically occurring within two business days. These trades represent the most straightforward and liquid segment of the FX market, driven by real-time supply and demand across global financial centers. Spot FX is commonly used by corporations hedging short-term currency exposure, financial institutions managing positions, and traders seeking to capitalize on rapid price movements. Because pricing is highly transparent and execution is nearly instantaneous, spot FX serves as the foundation for many other currency products, making it a critical component of global financial markets.
