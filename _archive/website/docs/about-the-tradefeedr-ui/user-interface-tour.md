# User Interface Tour

The **LuminaFlow UI** is a sleek, adaptive interface designed for systems where clarity and speed matter most. Its layout is built around a floating command ribbon that reacts to user intent—icons subtly illuminate as the cursor nears, offering contextual options without overwhelming the screen. Soft gradients and translucent panels give the interface a sense of depth, while micro-animations provide just enough feedback to make interactions feel responsive and alive.

Navigation relies on a dynamic "focus ring" that highlights the area of active work. When users shift tasks, the ring glides smoothly across the workspace, automatically rearranging tools and information based on recent behaviour. This creates a feeling of fluid workflow rather than jump-cut transitions between menus.

At the heart of the LuminaFlow UI is a conversational command palette. Users can type natural-language prompts—"show me recent activity," "filter by priority," "compare versions"—and the system instantly transforms the workspace. Combined with its modular widget system, the UI lets users curate a personalized environment that adapts as their projects evolve.
