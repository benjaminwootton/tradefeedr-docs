== Tradefeedr API Structure


Conceptually, each API call has two components:


* `API end-point` which can be thought of as function doing specific job. Consider for example API endpoint `v1/fx/algo/parent-orders`.

* JSON string containing a set of parameters for the API end-point function. The exact structure of the query string depends on the end point but the following parameters are typically present
** `groupby` –  variables by which the results would have to be grouped by. For example: `{'groupby':['Symbol']}` implies that results have to be grouped by symbol.
**  `var`    -  which variables should be returned in the end points.  For example
**  `filter` - how to filter the results.

All API end-points return a JSON dictionary which can translated into a Python Pandas DataFrame.
