= API Remote Access
Instruction on how to access the APIs remotely either through Jupyter or PyCharm.

== Remote Jupyter Access

=== Tradefeedr API Device File
---

Download link:{attachmentsdir}/tf_api_device.py[tf_api_device.py] from the Tradefeedr library.  

=== Instructions
---
Follow the instructions in the code cell below.

====
[source, python]

=== Instructions
---

Download the remote API access notebook link:{attachmentsdir}/tradefeedr_api_remote_use.ipynb[tradefeedr_api_remote_use.ipynb].
It provides a step by step guide using a Jupyter notebook.

* Step 1 - Import the tf_api_device and request a login

====
[source, python]
----
from tf_api_device import TfApiDevice
tf_api_device = TfApiDevice()
tf_api_device.request_login()
----
====

* Step 2 - Now copy the URL link generated and paste into an internet browser. This will load a page showing you that you are now connected

* Step 3 - Now request a token

====
[source, python]
----
tf_api_device.request_token()
----
====

* Step 4 - You can now run queries remotely as you would do on the Tradefeedr platform

The image below illustrates how to run the process from a notebook. Also, refer to link:{attachmentsdir}/tradefeedr_api_remote_use.ipynb[tradefeedr_api_remote_use.ipynb]

== Remote PyCharm Access


=== Tradefeedr API Device File
---

It is the same file located in the Remote Python ( Jupyter ) section of this document.


Download link:{attachmentsdir}/tf_api_device.py[tf_api_device.py] from the Tradefeedr library.


=== Request Token Files
---

Download link:{attachmentsdir}/request_token.py[request_token.py] from the Tradefeedr library.

====
[source, python]
----
include::example$api/request_token.txt[]
----
====

=== API Query
---

Download link:{attachmentsdir}/query_api.py[query_api.py] from the Tradefeedr library.


====
[source, python]
----
include::example$api/query_api.txt[]
----
====

=== Instructions
---

* Step 1 - Download the Tradefeedr files link:{attachmentsdir}/tf_api_device.py[tf_api_device.py], link:{attachmentsdir}/request_token.py[request_token.py] and link:{attachmentsdir}/query_api.py[query_api.py]. Save the files in the same file path

* Step 2 - Now run the request_token.py file. Copy the URL link generated and paste into an internet browser

* Step 3 - Now enter your one time code on the device activation page (generated by the link in the previous step)

* Step 4 - Click continue on the device activation page. This will now load a page showing you that you are connected

* Step 5 - Your console will now request a token automatically

* Step 6 - Once the token request is completed run the query_api.py file

* Step 7 - You should now see an output in your python console showing that the query was successful. You can modify the query_api.py file to run queries as you would do on the Tradefeedr platform
