AllInPrice,"Effective overall rate at which ParentOrderID was executed. For single leg executions it is TradeQuantityUSD-weighted-average Price over all child fills.
For multi-leg order each execution is split into individual currencies. Then effective currency balances of all executions are aggregated. Finally, effective rate is calculated as a ratio of the balance of target currencies. For example if target Symbol is AUDNOK and the AUD balance is 1m and NOK balance is 6m then the effective execution rate would be 6m/1m = 6.
